        <p>This shrimp pasta with olive oil is a light, flavorful, quick, and easy dinner. I eyeballed most of the recipe, but here's what I came up with. It has a little kick but not enough to overwhelm the fresh ingredients' flavors. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach</li>
            <li>1 zucchini, chopped</li>
            <li>1 yellow squash, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons lemon juice, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, occasionally stirring until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and return spaghetti to the pot</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir spinach, zucchini, squash, pine nuts, and garlic in hot oil until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat another tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shrimp and 2 teaspoons lemon juice until shrimp are bright pink and centers are opaque, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, parsley, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir vegetable mixture, shrimp, and olive oil mixture into spaghetti until combined.</li>
        </ol>
